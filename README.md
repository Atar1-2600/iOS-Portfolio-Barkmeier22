# iOS Portfolio
Hello, my name is Lucas Barkmeier, this is a portfolio for the projects/apps I have made throughout the years. My first exposure to coding was in 9th grade in my intro to technology where we used block coding on a website called [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/play/dungeon). I would say My first time making things with code was in 10th grade, in my Computer Science Principles class where we made games with MIT App Inventor, and later we all voted on best app and I won first place bragging rights. In 11th Grade I was in Java and Cyber Security Class where I learned coding in Python and Java. In 12th grade, I took IOS Development and learned swift in Xcode. So far, I have made 1 working app for fun, and currently working on another app with some classmates.

# Apps and Projects

2022

## [Frame Jumper](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Frame-Jumper)
This is an app I am curently working on my self. This was the first game I started making in xcode, and is a flappy bird like game where you bounce back and forth between a wall. While bouncing you have to dodge obsticals in the air and on the walls.

## [Lost & Found](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Minnesota-School-Lost-Found) 

The lost and found at many school including my own is stock full, students wil may look for hours and never find if the item is even there. The purpose of this app is to have staff take pictures of items in the lost and found so students can see what is in there without the pain of looking. For weeks, my group and I have been working on the functionality of the app and designing the user interface. I have mainly been working on the login page, I believe that this will keep other schools for using the wrong schools lost and found. Currently working on iCloud to store the data entries and working on the filter button.
