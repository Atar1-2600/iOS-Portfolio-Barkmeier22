# iOS Portfolio
Hello, my name is Lucas Barkmeier, this is a portfolio for the projects/apps I have made throughout the years. My first exposure to coding was in 9th grade in my intro to technology where we used block coding on a website called [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/play/dungeon). I would say My first time making things with code was in 10th grade, in my Computer Science Principles class where we made games with MIT App Inventor, and later we all voted on best app and I won first place bragging rights. In 11th Grade I was in Java and Cyber Security Class where I learned coding in Python and Java. In 12th grade, I took IOS Development and learned swift in Xcode. So far, I have made 1 working app for fun, and currently working on another app with some classmates.
